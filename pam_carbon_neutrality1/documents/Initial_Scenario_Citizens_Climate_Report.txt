Initial scenarios for citizens stakeholders from the Citizens Climate Report.

Primary Aims:

1. Reducing Emissions from Livestock Farming:
   * By 2030, emissions from livestock farming should be decreased by 50% or more. This requires a significant reduction in livestock numbers across Germany, including those in high stocking density operations (factory farming).

2. Ensuring Emission Reductions Are Not Offset by Imports:
   * The federal government must take appropriate measures to prevent emissions reductions achieved through decreased domestic meat and dairy production from being negated by imports.

3. Considering Carbon Content Impact in Export Policy:
   * Export policies should take into account the carbon content impact to ensure a sustainable approach.

4. Increasing Renewable Energy in the Total Energy Supply:
   * By 2035, 70% of Germany's total energy supply should be sourced from renewable sources, aiming to reduce carbon consumption. By 2040, this figure should reach 90%.

5. Achieving 100% Renewable Electricity Supply:
   * By 2035, Germany should strive for a complete transition to a renewable energy-based electricity supply, ensuring all electricity comes from renewable sources.


Steps for carbon neutralization:

1. Advancement of Wind Energy:
   * Wind energy promotion should be prioritized.

2. Accelerated Coal Phaseout:
   * The deadline for nationwide coal phaseout should be moved up from 2038 to 2030.

3. Enhanced Digitization in Rural Areas:
   * Emphasis should be placed on advancing and expanding digitization, particularly by improving fiber optic cables and mobile networks in rural regions.

4. Flexible Electricity Pricing:
   * Consumers' electricity prices should be adaptable and based on supply and demand within the electricity grid.

5. Electric Cars as Surplus Electricity Storage:
   * Electric vehicles should be utilized as temporary storage for excess electricity, compensating owners financially.

6. Extended Lifespan of Electronic Devices:
   * The intentional shortening of electronic device lifespans must be eliminated, and the minimum warranty period should be extended to 10 years.

7. Promotion of Citizen-Led Energy Initiatives:
   * Citizen-led energy cooperatives and companies should be encouraged to finance and expand renewable energy systems.

8. Public Engagement in Renewable Energy Projects:
   * Sufficient information about renewable energy projects and consideration of public opinion should be provided to the local population before commencing construction.

9. Strengthening Decentralized Energy Supply:
   * To achieve a balanced energy supply, both centralized and decentralized sources need to be strengthened.

10. Utilization of Agricultural Land and Water Areas:
   * Where feasible, agricultural land and water areas should be utilized for electricity generation.

11. Expansion of Photovoltaic Systems:
   * Available areas such as parking lots, fallow land, and unused building lots should be assessed for their potential to host photovoltaic system expansions.

12. Land Allocation for Renewable Energy Generation:
   * Each federal state should dedicate at least two percent of its total land area to expanding photovoltaic and wind energy generation.

13. Municipality Plans for Climate Neutrality:
   * By involving citizens, every municipality must develop a plan to achieve climate neutrality in the energy sector by 2030, with the deadline set for 2023.


14. Mandatory Photovoltaic Systems on Rooftops:
   * Starting in 2022, the gradual introduction and inclusion of photovoltaic systems on rooftops should be mandatory in all construction plans.
