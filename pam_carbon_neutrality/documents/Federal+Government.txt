As a federal government we are taking steps to enforce tighten regulations for the climate and implement laws to achieve green house gas neutrality by 2045.

Our primary aims are :-
1. Reduce emissions by 65 % of 1990 levels by 2030
2. Reduce emissions by 88% by 20240
3. Achieve carbon neutrality by 2045

The Bundestag has approved the amended climate changed act. Later it was given final touch by Bundesrat.

We have to come up with allowed CO2 emissions for different sectors such as energy, industry, transport and buildings.

Federal Environment Minister Svenja schilze says �This climate change act provides a framework for the years and decades to come�

Every two years, the council of Experts for climate matters will monitor and come with the report of the goals achieved, and measures and trends. Based on the budget, Federal Government will adjusts its approach.


Steps for carbon neutralisation
1. Strengthening the natural sinks
2. Intensify support for decarbonisation of the industrial sector, green hydrogen, energy-focused building refurbishments, climate-friendly mobility, as well as sustainable forestry and agriculture.
